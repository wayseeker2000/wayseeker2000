- 👋 Hi, I’m @wayseeker2000
- 👀 I’m interested in game design.  Specifically, I'm working on developing a traditional rogue-like game in Godot Engine using gdscript.  I have also enjoyed getting to know more about general programming around Bash Scripting and working with Github.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash scripting for Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.  I have very little time to work on what I currently have to do, so I'm afraid my time must be reserved for that.  Perhaps, after I learn more and more time becomes available, I may seek out collaboration.
- 📫 How to reach me: wayseeker52@gmail.com
